One of the newer game systems that I've had the pleasure of playing, and certainly a lot of fun. The flexibility that being able to choose so many more aspects of your character opens up compared to, for example, Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition's way of doing things, makes each character feel very different. Add in Archetypes for a fantastic take on multiclassing that isn't _quite_ multiclassing in the traditional sense, and you get a game that is fantastic at making abilities and combos feel unique and powerful.

There's a very good reason that I'm currently playing not one but _two_ different Pathfinder 2nd Edition games. The character creation process was confusing at first, but I quickly got the hang of it and was able to make characters that I really enjoy, and despite seeing characters similar to my own in other campaigns that I listen to and read about, none of them feel like they'd be stepping on my characters' toes if they somehow happened upon one another in the same campaign.

I would thoroughly recommend this system to someone that is looking for something similar to Dungeons and Dragons but still distinct in its own right.
