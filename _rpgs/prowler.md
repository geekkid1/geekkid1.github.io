An incredibly flexible game about making a superhero and then kicking butt with them. It uses a unique d6 dice pool system that I've not seen before, and it honestly makes the whole system a bit swingier in terms of numbers than I'd strictly like. The range of results a single roll can have ranges _wildly_ from extreme failure to extreme success, without much grouping around the mean to keep things at least moderately consistent.

That said, the power system is very reasonably built. Many of the powers narratively work very well with one another despite largely being disconnected from one another. This leads to characters that feel cohesive and meaningful despite the fact that you could basically just stack whatever set of powers you want onto them. It _does_ feel a bit broken at times, but that can be fixed with a good group; the book explicitly leaves it up to the GM whether certain effects that stack with each other and hypothetically break the game actually do so.

All in all I quite enjoy it despite its flaws, and greatly recommend it to anyone that is considering playing it.
