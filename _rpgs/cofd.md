Honestly an incredibly expansive game system. I am using this article as a stand-in for all of the different Chronicles of Darkness 2nd Edition game lines, because I started playing many of them around the same time. The ones that I have played include, in the order that I have played them:

* Changeling the Lost
* Werewolf the Forsaken
* Mage the Awakened
* Vampire the Requiem

And, of course, the main Mortal game line which also includes the expanded supernatural micro-templates. All in all it's a very versatile system, since its game lines are often inter-compatible. This means you can play games with _drastically_ different characters with drastically different abilities and it works mechanically. It may not end up being balanced, but it works.
