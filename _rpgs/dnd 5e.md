What is there to say about Dungeons and Dragons that hasn't been said already, especially 5th edition? It's only the most popular table top role playing game out there!

It was the first table top rpg that I was introduced to, and it's certainly the one that I've played the most. I have been intermittently in several committed Dungeons and Dragons campaigns from when I first started playing it just over a year after 5th Edition was released to when I'm writing this article in mid 2025. It's not my favorite, but I certainly can't say it's without merit. If it was, it wouldn't be where it is now.

I admit, I haven't played much of the new revised 2024 rules, since my tables have been playing for so long we decided to stick with what we knew.
