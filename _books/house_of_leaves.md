House of Leaves is a _fantastic_ example of slow-burn horror. It follows stories within stories, starting with a man that finds an unfinished manuscript for a documentary that does not exist inside his recently deceased blind neighbor's apartment.

What follows is a multi-layered descent into madness, one which I certainly will not spoil any of for anyone that may be reading this without first having read the book. It is a rare book that is _intrinsic_ to the printed medium, taking advantage of strange color, format, and pattern techniques to heighten the dizzying confusion that pervades the story and enhances the dread.
