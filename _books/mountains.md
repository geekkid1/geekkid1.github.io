At the Mountains of Madness is one of H.P. Lovecraft's best works in my opinion. This review represents my 2025 re-read of it, since I do not have definitive dates for when I first read it. Missing much of the racist and unintelligible undertones of the rest of his work, At the Mountains of Madness was unfortunately negatively recieved in its time and was cited by Lovecraft himself as causing the downfall of his writing career.

Even so, it stands as a classic science-fiction cosmic horror story, full of vivid descriptive language and unreliable narration following an expedition to the Antarctic that uncovers a vast, ancient, inhuman civilization. Bit by bit, this expedition learns more and more. As the horrible truth dawns on the members of the expedition and the narrator, so too does it dawn on the reader.
