The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy is a classic piece of science-fiction comedy and a must-read for anyone that wants to enjoy a dive into Douglas Adams's wacky universe full of aliens that are horrible at poetry, roguish thieves with two heads and three arms, and a human from a planet that is only designated "Mostly Harmless".

Since I don't want to upload individual reviews of each of the novels in the series, please consider this my clear, concise, and complete opinion of the classics that Adams originally made for radio but that so perfectly translated into the written medium.
