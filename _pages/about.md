My name is Emily Blum, but _something_ makes me think you knew that already. In all seriousness, this is my personal site. As of right now, it's pretty heavily under construction since the template that I used came with a lot of included information that has nothing to do with me.

So please bear with me as I make sure that everything on this website reflects the actual me, so you can learn more about me. I started with [the cv page](/cv) so go check it out if you want!

I have also done some work adding some [books that I have read and am currently reading](/books) if you want to check that out. It's a little bit more just a journaling thing for me but it's public and it looks nice so take a look!
